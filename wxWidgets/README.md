# Introduction
This folder is dedicated to the initial research and implementation of wxWidgets. Neither of the following examples is to be implemented in the final project, but they are rather used as a basis for understanding wxWidgets so that future implementations can be made.

The WxAppTest directory walks through a "hello world" demo, and provides commenting throughout the code files to understand some of the basics of working with wxWidgets. For further explanation, view the directory-specific [README](WxAppTest/README.md).

The wxFormBuilder/hello_world_trial directory gives a similar level example using wxFormBuilder as a base. For further explanation, view the directory-specific [README](wxFormBuilder/hello_world_trial/README.md).

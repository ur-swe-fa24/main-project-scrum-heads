# Introduction
This folder contains a test trial of wxWidgets that implements the ["Hello World" Introduction](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/latest/overview_helloworld.html) from wxWidgets' website. All code was copied directly from the provided source, but there is additional documentation in the form of thorough commenting taken from information within the tutorial. 

# How to Use
+ Use `cmake` to build the project while in the root directory.
+ `./WxAppTest` to run the executable.
+ Once the application is running, it should display a window that says "Welcome to wxWidgets!"
+ With the application open, you can use the toolbar on the top of your screen to interact with it. File -> Hello... displays a message, and so does WxAppTest -> About.

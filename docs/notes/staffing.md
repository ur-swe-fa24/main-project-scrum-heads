# Initial Staffing Plan

*Note: the following assignments are for our primary responsibilities/areas of focus for this project, but they are in no means restrictive, and the specific workload for individual sprints will be determined fluidly. These four components are interconnected and cannot be developed individually in a vacuum, and all members of the team will be working on parts of different components besides the one they are assigned to; this is just an indication of where the majority of our time will be spent, and was derived from personal interests. Additionally, as our understanding of the time commitment for each of these components evolves, necessary refocuses in attention will be made.*

- **Jeremy White**: Graphical User Interface  
- **Kay Conrad**: Status Database  
- **Qing Shen**: Simulation Engine  
- **Yili Zhang**: System Manager

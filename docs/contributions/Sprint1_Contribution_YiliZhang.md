# Sprint1_Contribution_Yili_Zhang

 In completing this project, I authored a comprehensive set of PlantUML sequence diagrams, each meticulously documented to delineate the interactions within our robot fleet management system. My efforts were focused on ensuring that the diagrams accurately represented real-time operations and error-handling mechanisms, enhancing the system's operational transparency and reliability.

+ **Diagram Development**: I developed detailed sequence diagrams to illustrate the system's functionality across various modules, including real-time data processing by the Simulation Engine, interactions with the System Manager, and communications with the Status Database. These diagrams provide visual clarity on the system architecture and its operational flows.

+ **Documentation**: I crafted thorough documentation for each sequence diagram, which not only describes the processes but also explains the role of each system component in operational and error scenarios. This documentation is vital for onboarding new developers and serves as a reference for future system enhancements.

+ **System Insights**: My work on these diagrams and their documentation has provided valuable insights into the system's functionality, facilitating better understanding and communication among the development team and stakeholders. This contributes to more informed decision-making and efficient system troubleshooting.

# Kay Conrad Sprint3 Contribution Statement
For this sprint, I focused a lot on helping the datamanager work with the database. I wrote a lot of test case for the database. I wanted to be sure that my database held the information correctly in order to make sure that the other portions could tell when they needed to debug and there were no inconsistences in the tables. I also helped with debugging when we connected the live updates. This includes understanding where we were losing data and finding where the data was not correctly being updated in the simulation and in the datamanager. I also changed the error log functions in order to more easily give the information to the UI because there was a weird UI issue when supplying a very long string. I believe that my work did help a lot during this sprint.

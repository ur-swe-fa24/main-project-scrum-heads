My primary component of focus for this project is the GUI, and that remained true for sprint 1. Therefore, I created the sequence diagrams that model user interaction with the UI in more detail, as well as the wireframe diagrams, and created documentation for both sets of diagrams. I also worked directly on creating the GUI part of the architecture diagram. However, I received input from all of the members on the team, in the same way I gave them all input for their respective components.

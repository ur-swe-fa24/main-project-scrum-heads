I did research on wxWidgets, both while using wxFormBuilder and without. Research consisted of reading official documentation, as well as watching tutorial videos from other UI developers. The major goal of this sprint for me was to get a decent handle on how to use wxWidgets in conjunction with wxFormBuilder to efficiently build projects. I did a lot of work with CMake to make my various tests come together, and worked together with Kay to make the integrated CMake setup for our project.

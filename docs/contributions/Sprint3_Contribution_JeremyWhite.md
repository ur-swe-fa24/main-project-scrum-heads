I continued working on wxWidgets, now starting on the actual final project implementation. I developed a frame for selecting user role, four respective frames for the different user roles, and started to flesh out the functionality of the field engineer, including the ability to add robots and check the properties of added robots. I began working on integrating with the system manager, and added local logic to mock this integration, with the refresh button in the field engineer view mocking the functionality of the UI receiving data from the system manager.

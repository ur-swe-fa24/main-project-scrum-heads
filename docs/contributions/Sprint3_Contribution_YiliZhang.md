# Sprint3_Contribution_Yili_Zhang

For this sprint I started a few attempts designing and implementing a modular system following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. My work included developing a `DBdriver` class for MongoDB interactions, integrating it with the `DataManager` as the Controller, and ensuring interaction between the `Robot` and `RoomTask` models and the `feBaseFrame` view.

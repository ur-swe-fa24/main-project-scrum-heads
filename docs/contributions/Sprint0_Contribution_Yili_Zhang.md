## Contributions:

### User Stories Development
+ Developed comprehensive user stories to guide the development and integration of the System Manager component in the fleet management system. This involved identifying and articulating the needs and goals of the system from the perspective of end users and system administrators.


### Product Backlog Items (PBI) Creation
+ Created detailed PBIs based on the user stories to outline the specific tasks, features, and functionalities that need to be developed. These PBIs provide a clear roadmap for developers and ensure that all aspects of the user stories are addressed in the development process.


### Acceptance Criteria Formulation
+ Formulated precise acceptance criteria for each PBI to define the conditions under which each task is considered complete. This is crucial for quality assurance and ensures that each functionality meets the required standards and operates as intended.

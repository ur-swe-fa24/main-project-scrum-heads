# Diagrams
The following is a list of the different diagrams that capture the essence of the project.

## Architecture Diagram

## Class Diagram
+ The class diagram indicates the general structure of classes and relationship between classes. It also listed the attributes and methods for each class. To see the diagram and its documentation continue to the link below.

## UI Sequence Diagram
+ The UI sequence diagram details more specifically the interactions between users and the UI. Instead of being broken down by individual user roles, it is sectioned by UI functionality. To see the diagrams and their complete documentation continue to the link below.

## Entity Sequence Diagram
+ Our Entity Sequence Diagram shows the interactions among four acotrs and four etities. To see the full breakdown and diagram continue to the link below.

## Wireframe Diagram
+ Our wireframe diagrams model a rough outline of what the physical user interface screen will look like. There are a few different diagrams for the various screens users may see. Not every user has access to every view, nor do they necessarily have access to all the information in a single view. To see the diagrams and more thorough documentation, continue through the link below.

# Activity Diagram Documentation

![Activity_Diagram](ActivityDiagram.png)

## Overview

The activity diagram provided outlines the operational workflow of the `test_robot.cpp` function, which serves as the system manager for our robot management system. This documentation aims to explain the diagram's components and their relationships to each other, ensuring a clear understanding of how user inputs dictate the system's behavior.

## Diagram Description

The activity diagram illustrates the sequential steps involved when a field engineer interacts with the robot management system. It details the decision-making process based on user roles and actions, depicting how these inputs lead to different system responses.

### Key Components

- **Start/End Points**: Indicate the beginning and termination of the process.
- **User Role Verification**: Ensures that only authorized users (Field Engineers) can proceed with actions within the system.
- **Action Decision**: Based on the userâ€™s selection, the system either initiates a robot creation process or displays the status of an existing robot.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Provide real-time responses to the user, including confirmation of actions taken or errors encountered.

## Process Flow

1. **Initialization**: The program begins, and the user is prompted to enter their role.
2. **Role Verification**: The user's input is verified. If the role matches "FieldEngineer," the process moves forward. If not, access is denied, and the process ends.
3. **Action Prompt**: Verified users are asked to choose between creating a new robot or viewing the status of an existing one.
4. **Process Execution**:
    - **Create Robot**: If selected, the system initializes a list for robots, creates a temporary robot object, and attempts to add it to the system. Success or failure feedback is provided based on whether the robot is added.
    - **View Robot Status**: If selected, the system assumes the presence of a predefined robot and displays its status.
